# Iris-Flowers-Classification-
Iris Flower Species Classification
This repository contains a machine learning project that focuses on classifying different species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. The Iris flower dataset is a well-known dataset in the machine learning community and is often used as a beginner's introduction to classification tasks.

Dataset
The dataset consists of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. These features are used to predict the species of the Iris flower. The dataset contains three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Project Overview
In this project, we perform the following steps:

Data Loading and Exploration: We start by loading the Iris dataset and gaining insights into its structure. We examine the feature distributions and relationships between different features.

Data Preprocessing: We clean the data, handle any missing values, and deal with potential outliers or anomalies that might affect our model's performance.

Data Visualization: We create visualizations like scatter plots and histograms to visualize the relationships between the features and the target species.

Feature Selection: For simplicity, we focus on using two features: petal length and sepal length, which are commonly used for this type of classification.

Model Selection and Training: We choose a classification algorithm, such as the Random Forest classifier, to train on the dataset. The classifier learns patterns from the feature data to predict the correct species.

Model Evaluation: We evaluate the model's performance on a testing dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps us understand how well the model is performing.

Predictions: After training and evaluating the model, we can use it to make predictions on new, unseen data. This showcases the practical application of the trained model.
